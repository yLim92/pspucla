<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>The National Society of Leadership and Success first began with the founder, Gary Tuerack, who had a vision of creating a community where like-minded success-oriented individuals could come together to learn from and support each other.</p>

<p>As a child, Gary struggled in school due to his inability to read quickly. However, after learning strategies to increase his reading speed along with concentration, memory, and grades, he became an Ivy League graduate. Despite his circumstance, he was able to achieve seemingly unrealistic goals because he was dedicated, focused, proactive and supported. That is also why he decided to spend next decade helping out college students to achieve their own success.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin said, &quot;Many people die at 25 and aren&#39;t buried until 75.&quot; People tend to give up on their dreams because they believe they are impossible. However, through the Society, we hope that people will wake up and believe in and discover their own potential.</p>
