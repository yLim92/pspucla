	<h2>I missed the info sessions! What should I do?</h2>
	<p>Don't stress, there are other ways to get information about Phi Sigma Pi! Attending an info session is for your personal benefit but is not mandatory for rush eligibility.  Explore the site, check out <a href="http://phisigmapi.org/">phisigmapi.org</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rush.phisigmapi">facebook.com/rush.phisigmapi</a>, or follow <a href="https://twitter.com/phisigmapi_ucla">@phisigmapi_ucla</a> for more information.</p>

	<h2>I'm in another sorority/fraternity/honor society. Can I still join?</h2>
	<p>Yes! Phi Sigma Pi allows Brothers to also participate in other Greek organizations.</p>

	<h2>Do winter and spring count as two quarters?</h2>
	<p>Yes, you are still eligible to rush in winter even if you are graduating at the end of the school year.</p>

	<h2>Is there hazing involved?</h2>
	<p>Official UCLA and Phi Sigma Pi policy prohibit hazing. We believe that hazing promotes a negative experience for everyone involved, therefore we do NOT condone any form of hazing.</p>

	<h2>What if my GPA falls below 3.0?</h2>
	<p>You will have a probationary Quarter in which you can bring your GPA up.</p> 

	<h2>Why are girls also called "Brothers"?</h2>
	<p>Brotherhood is a term that supersedes sex and gender so we are all Brothers regardless of how we identify.</p>
